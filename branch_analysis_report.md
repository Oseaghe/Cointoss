# Branch Analysis Report (Updated)

## Overview

This report summarizes the current state of the `From-Ralph` branch of the Cointoss project after recent improvements, testing, and stabilization efforts.

---

## 1. Build & Runtime Issues

-   **.env File & Build:**

    -   The `.env` file is present and correctly configured.
    -   The application builds and runs successfully.

-   **Duplicate Dependencies:**

    -   Review `pom.xml` for duplicate dependencies (e.g., `org.postgresql:postgresql`, `org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql`, `me.paulschwarz:spring-dotenv`).
    -   Remove any duplicates if still present.

-   **Deprecated API Usage:**
    -   The warning about `sun.misc.Unsafe` is from a dependency (Guice); monitor for updates, but not urgent.

---

## 2. Static Code Analysis

-   **Entity Naming/Structure:**

    -   Entities are singular (`Bet`, `BettingPool`, etc.) and relationships are correctly mapped.

-   **Service/Controller/Repository Layers:**

    -   All layers are implemented and functional.

-   **Unit and Integration Tests:**

    -   Comprehensive unit tests exist for all major services and are passing.

-   **Security & Validation:**

    -   Spring Security is configured, JWT authentication and password hashing are implemented, and input validation is present.

-   **Unused/Deprecated Code:**
    -   No obvious unused or deprecated code in the scanned files.
